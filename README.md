## Towards a Deep Learning Framework for Unconstrained Face Detection 
### Introduction
This repository is a fork from [py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn) and demonstrates the performance of PVANet.
You can refer to [py-faster-rcnn README.md](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn/blob/master/README.md) and [faster-rcnn README.md](https://github.com/ShaoqingRen/faster_rcnn/blob/master/README.md) for more information.

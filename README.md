# face_detection_caffe
This is an implementation of "Towards a Deep Learning Framework for Unconstrained Face Detection " (arxiv 2016) in caffe 
### Introduction
This repository is a fork from [py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn) and demonstrates the performance of PVANet.
You can refer to [py-faster-rcnn README.md](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn/blob/master/README.md) and [faster-rcnn README.md](https://github.com/ShaoqingRen/faster_rcnn/blob/master/README.md) for more information.
##Setup
1.put wider_face.py and fddb.py in dataset/ 

2.put models/wider_face/VGG16/faster_rcnn_end2end/

3.put faster_rcnn_end2end_ms.sh in
